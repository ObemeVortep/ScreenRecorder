# 🖥️ ScreenRecorder – A Modern C++ Learning Project

This repository documents a personal project focused on deepening my understanding of **modern C++ (C++17/20)** through the development of a screen recording system.

The goal is not to create a production-ready tool, but to apply and internalize **idiomatic C++**, **RAII**, **STL usage**, **multithreading**, **networking**, and **systems-level design patterns** in a real, evolving project.

### 🔍 Objectives

- Practice **idiomatic C++ design** with clear ownership and safe memory management.
- Apply **RAII** principles consistently and eliminate raw resource handling.
- Use **standard containers**, **algorithms**, and **smart pointers** appropriately.
- Build components with **multithreading** and **networking** in mind.
- Structure the code to reflect **real-world software engineering habits**.

### 🔧 Planned Capabilities

- Screen capture using low-level system APIs.
- Future: **capture system audio and microphone input** (if available).
- Future: **mouse cursor overlay**.
- Future: **transmit captured frames over the network**.

> 🧠 This project is a self-contained exercise in writing clear, robust, idiomatic C++ code — with the intent to go beyond theory and actually **build** something while learning.
>
> ⏳ Expected timeline: ~2–3 weeks of focused development.
